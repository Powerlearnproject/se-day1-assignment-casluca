#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is abranch of computerscience dealing with developing,testing and maintaining of software applications.
    **importances of software technology are:**
        1. optimise company operations
        2. streamline company processes
        3. gives a competitive edge to a company
        4. helps businesses manage data efficiently
        5. helps businesses analyse customer patterns
        6. helps businesses make informed decisions that drive growth and profitability
        7. helps businesses create secure online platforms that facilitate transactions and protect sensitive customer information

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    1. "hacking” or “programming by intuition. Software development primarily done by individuals or small teams who wrote code based on their own experiences and knowledge. 
    2. structured programming and the use of flowcharts to represent algorithms in the 1960's and 1970's
    3. Introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1980s led to a shift in how software was designed and developed
    4. The emergence of the Agile software development methodologies, which emphasized flexibility and responsiveness to chang in the 1990's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    1. Planning- requirements regarding the project are gathered.
    2. Analysis- the team must determine the feasibility and how to successfully complete the project with minimal risk. During the planning phase
    3. Design- ransforming the software specification into a design plan called the design specification.
    4. Development- the actual development begins, and programming is built.
    5. Testing- is tested against the requirements to ensure that the product meets the requirements addressed and captured during the requirements phase.
    6. Implementation- The final software is released and checked for deployment issues based on project manager feedback
    7. Maintenance-  addressing remaining bugs that could not be patched before release or resolving new issues that users have reported based on her reports, support and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    While the Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential approach with distinct phases where each stage must be completed before moving to the next, Agile utilizes an iterative     and incremental process, allowing for flexibility and continuous feedback throughout the development cycle, making it better suited for projects with changing requirements and high       customer involvement; in contrast, Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined needs and minimal expected changes

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  A Software Developer is responsible for:
    1. designing, coding, testing, and deploying software applications by analyzing user needs
    2. creating code to meet those requirements
    3. ensuring the software functions properly through testing and debugging, while also maintaining and updating existing applications to enhance performance and functionality.

  A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer is responsible for:
    1. ensuring that a product, typically software, meets all quality standards
    2. actively identifying and reporting defects throughout the development process
    3. reviewing documentation, designing test plans, executing tests, and collaborating with development teams to prevent issues before release to the customer
  Project managers in software engineering:
    1. organize software projects
    2. assigning tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of a task.
    3. Software project managers use their leadership skills, technical knowledge and experience to direct their teams and ensure software meets client requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining         capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software         developers use IDEs to make their job easier. eg Visual Studo code, Sublime text
    A Version Control System (VCS) is crucial in software development as it allows developers to track changes made to code over time, enabling efficient collaboration, easy rollback to     previous versions, and effective conflict resolution when multiple developers work on the same codebase simultaneously; popular examples of VCS include Git, Subversion (SVN), and        Mercurial 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  1. Rapid Technological Advancement. Adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends
  2. Growing Customer and Client Demands.
  3. software engineers must understand underlying business concepts to ensure that the required features satisfy end users’ needs.
  4. Time Constraints. effective time management strategies eg streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints
  5. Limited Infrastructure. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  **Unit testing** focuses on the smallest testable parts of your code, like individual functions or methods. Developers typically write these tests to verify that each unit behaves as     expected in isolation
      **Importance:**
        Early Bug Detection: Catches issues early in the development process when they are easier and cheaper to fix.
        Code Confidence: Gives developers confidence that their code works correctly, making it easier to make changes and refactor.
        Documentation: Unit tests can se rve as a form of living documentation, showing how individual units of code are intended to function.

  **Integration Testing** checks how different units or components of your application work together. It verifies that the interactions between these components are correct.
    **Importance:**
        Interface Validation: Ensures that the interfaces between components are well-defined and that data is passed correctly.
        Dependency Issues: Uncovers problems related to dependencies between different parts of the system.
        System as a Whole: Provides a higher level of confidence that the system as a whole will function correctly.

 **System testing** evaluates the entire system as a whole against the defined requirements. It's often done in an environment that closely resembles the production environment.
    **Importance:**
        Requirements Verification: Confirms that the system meets all the specified functional and non-functional requirements.
        End-to-End Functionality: Tests the complete flow of data and actions through the system, mimicking real-world scenarios.
        Performance and Stability: Evaluates the system's performance, stability, and security under various conditions.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
  
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering isn't just about writing better prompts, it's about understanding how to communicate effectively with AI systems to solve real-world problems. 
    1. Control over AI response
    2. Enhanced response accuracy and relevance
    3. Customization and adaptability of vague prompts
    4. Accessibility to AI for non-technical users
    5. Mitigating bias and inappropriate contentand responses
    6. Generating domain-specific expertise
  


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague prompt: Write something about technology
  Ipmroved prompt: Write a 500-word article discussing three recent advancements in generative AI for image creation, such as DALL-E 3, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.  Explain how       these advancements differ from previous image generation techniques and discuss the potential impact of these technologies on the fields of art, design, and advertising.  Include        specific examples of images generated by these models
  why the improved prompt is more effective:
  1. Specific Topic
  2. Defined Scope
  3. Clear Format and Length
  4. Target Audience and Purpose
  5. Specific Request: It asks for "specific examples of images,
